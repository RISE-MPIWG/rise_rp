RISE RESOURCE PROVIDER APP

This rails application allows you to maintain collections, resources, sections and 
content units and make them available through a SHINE-compatible api.

INSTALLATION
you will need to have docker and docker-compose installed on the host you wish to run this software on.

> docker-compose up --build
wait until the stack is up, then,
> docker exec -it rise_rp_web_1 bash
will take you into the web container. then, execute the following within the container:
> bundle exec rake db:create
> bundle exec rake db:migrate
to set up the database.
and you should be good to go!
you can deploy the stack to a docker swarm host by doing the following:
> export DOCKER_HOST=<your.docker.host>:2375
> docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.production.yml rise_rp --with-registry-auth
although you might need to have access to fresh builds of the images required by the stack: please modify docker-compose.production.yml to your convenience.
